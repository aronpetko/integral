Integral is a [UCI-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) chess engine developed in C++. It is a personal project developed with the goal of meshing my admiration for chess with programming. \

## Usage
Integral supports the following UCI commands (not all listed):
- `uci` Prints information about Integral and replies with `uciok`
- `ucinewgame` Sets up a new game and clears the transposition table
- `isready` Replies with `readyok`
- `position startpos` Sets the board state and pieces to the starting position
- `position fen <string>` Sets the board state and pieces to the given [FEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) string
- `position fen <string> moves <e2e4 e7e5 ...>` Plays the given moves from the FEN position
- `go depth <depth>` Searches up to the given depth and replies with `bestmove <move>`
- `go infinite` Searches up to the maximum search depth (100) and replies with `bestmove <move>`
- `go wtime <time> btime <time> winc <inc> binc <inc>` Searches for and replies with the best move given within the time/increment allotted. The amount of time used is managed by an internal time management system to ensure the engine doesn't run out of time
- `go movetime <time>` Searches for the best move using the full time allotted
- `go [infinite]` Searches for an infinite amount of time
- `go perft <depth>` Runs a split perft test on the current position up the specified depth

Integral also supports some non-standard commands:
- `test [see|perft]` Runs tests on static exchange evaluation (SEE) and/or move generation (perft)
- `bench [depth]` Performs a search on the current position up to the specified depth and returns the node count

## Compilation
> [!NOTE]  
> Integral must be compiled with either GCC v13 (or higher) or Clang v15 (or higher)

Integral provides a Makefile for compatibility with CMake and ease of use.\
To compile Integral, enter the following commands in a terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/aronpetko/integral
cd integral
make <native|x86_64_bmi2|x86_64_modern|x86_64>
```

## Rating
Integral is estimated to be around 3380 [CCRL](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/) Blitz, which puts it at a super-human level.
